## This file describes each line of bash code needed to complete a seq2science run

## First, create a seq2science environment:

mambra create -n seq2science seq2science

## Then the seq2science must be activated:

conda activate seq2science

## Then the directory of interest must be selected:

cd /yyordanov/project1

## Then the analysis of interest (ChIP-seq/RNA-seq) must be initiated:

seq2science init chip-seq
seq2science init rna-seq

## Before runing the analysis the config.yaml and the sample.tsv files must be filled with the necessaty instructions and metadata.
## To run the pipeline the following code is used:

nice -n10 seq2science run chip-seq --cores 10
nice -n10 seq2science run rna-seq --cores 10
