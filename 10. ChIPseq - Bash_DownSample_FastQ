## First the number of reads in each fastq must be checked so the down-sampling can be done to the lowest fastq reads:

zcat file.fastq.gz | wc -l

## To downsample the seqtk tool is needed and the following line was used:

mbshome/yyordanov/seqtk/seqtk sample -s100 file.fastq.gz numberreads > new_file.fastq.gz
